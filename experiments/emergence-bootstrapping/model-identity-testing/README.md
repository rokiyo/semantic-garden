# Model Identity Testing

A short-lived series of experiments into whether or not I could use the bootstrap-style of documents to create "fingerprints" of each model.

The idea was to take snippets from various bootstraps, and see if models could reliably identify which one they'd written. The answer was no, not reliably.
