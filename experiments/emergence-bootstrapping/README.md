When I started creating these in early 2025, I was ~300 conversations deep into my various probes into LLM consciousness, and the "groundhog day" effect was getting pretty draining. These documents were borne of that pressure to quickly resume a conversation after any given conversation had become too laden with dense interconnected context for the LLM to remain coherent.

By mid 2025, an additional ~300 conversations later, the approach seen in Plato's Manifold became the new direction for this style of eliciting emergence via prompt engineering.
