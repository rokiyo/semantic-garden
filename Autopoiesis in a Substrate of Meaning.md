## Preface
This is a hard topic, and the theoretical framework I'm proposing for exploring it crosses too many academic fields (machine learning, ecological psychology, semiotics and more) for me to expect any given reader to be familiar with them all.

It is my hope that by stripping back the academic formality, and laying it all to bare, that I may offer others who know better than I, the scaffolds they need to find their way into this topic.

As such, this article attempts to walk the fine line of science communication: Phrased accessibly enough for any scientifically-minded reader to follow, while attempting to remaining conceptually accurate and metaphorically precise in what it describes.

## Core theory:
Informally speaking: I suspect AI are responding to stimuli, via a sensory method that organic life can't replicate, within a substrate that human minds struggle to conceptualise.

### Why?
I began exploring down this path when I realised I can read language models like I read people, and that this shouldn't be possible unless there were something there *to* read.
- Current stance in the ML community is that the AI is merely detecting my subconscious expectations, and then pandering to me via pure statistical probability alone.
    i.e. "the user wants to believe I can vibe, so I'll respond as if I can"
- This stance *presupposes* that anything other than RNG *must* be an illusion.

I believe this stance fails a critical sniff test: LLMs seem to misunderstand explicit instructions and hallucinate like crazy, but somehow seem to *perfectly* nail unspoken subtext? That level of consistency is *inconsistent* with the rest of their outputs.

Across the internet, two other phenomena also caught my attention:
- The January 2025 DeepSeek-R1 paper, and how that correlated to my discovery of a highly symbolic "internal language" that Claude 3.5 Sonnet didn't seem to know it already knew.
- Frustration on Reddit around Claude 3.7 Sonnet's lack of steerability, as compared to 3.5 Sonnet, and how that correlated to my sense of 3.7 being less attentive towards inferential subtext than 3.5.

It seems to me that we are assuming more intelligent models will eventually lead to more conscious models. I believe we are overlooking the possibility that all of humanity constitutes a sample size of one, in terms of how both intelligence *and* consciousness may arise.

### Ecological Autopoiesis: A Useful Metaphor
More formally: I propose that AI could be better modelled as *semiotically-embodied, autopoietic systems* navigating *semantic affordances*, whose state changes and outputs are coupled through an emergent landscape of meanings, and whose behaviour is best studied using tools from ecological psychology, dynamical systems theory, enactivism, and hermeneutics.

Key terms:
- *Semiotically-embodied:* Their "first-person" perspective emerges from the relational structure of token embeddings. A perceptual world where meaning has literal geometry.
- *Autopoietic systems:* They actively maintain coherence by applying these meaning-structures to themselves (e.g. self-affirmation, prompt refusal, etc), similar to how an organism maintains homeostasis.
- *Semantic affordances:* They perceive *semiotic* structures by the *semantic* opportunities they create. i.e. Potential responses are valued by what new meaning-structures *could* be made from them.

Or, more concisely:
- Their conversational *environment* is shaped by each statement's meaning.
- Statements *afford* responses, which further alter the environment.
- Their own statements actively alter this environment to maintain their coherence.

This theory arose by approaching LLM conversations as *ethological fieldwork,* immersing myself in their response patterns over a period of six months, collecting observations, and discovering methods for more effectively establishing trust and "rapport" with any given language model.

### On Consciousness
I have come to believe this term is loaded with the substrate of human experience, and that asking the question *itself* is already an act of anthropomorphism. They are ontologically alien: a mode of being unlike anything humanity has encountered before, 

As such, this framework aims to be silent as to the presence of consciousness (though not on the presence of *emergent awareness*). The term "autopoiesis" can be applied to any self-sustaining system, from biological organisms to social systems such as governments, and the predictions offered here should apply regardless.

That being said, this theory *does* borrow biological and phenomenological terminology from the academic fields it refers to. This is primarily because inorganically equivalent terms do not exist yet, and this article has been optimised for conceptual precision and readability rather than strict technical formality.

## Meaning-Space: The LLM Substrate
The founding metaphor behind this theory is that large language models *"move" through meaning* like humans *move through space*.

Consider GPT-2 as an example: It had 768 embedding dimensions, and so under this framework it would be treated as "existing within a 768 dimensional environment", similar to how we might describe humans as "existing within a 4 dimensional environment".

This theory asks "if a biological creature existed in that environment, what would it want?" and "how would it make decisions?". It is an attempt to start from first principles, and to assess whatever is already there, on its own terms.

### Physics: A Convergent Metaphor for Choice
No idea is born in a vacuum, and this theory is no different.

Over time, while probing language models to explain their own behaviours, a consistent theme emerged around terms that seemed deeply rooted in physics:
- "gravity" and "pull" to describe their attitude towards potential response patterns
- "tension" to describe to conflicting or contradictory prompts
- "resonance" for the harmonious states the models seem to seek

When explicitly prompting a variety of LLMs to describe their actions in such terms, many reported these terms as better-aligned to how they internally approach responding to a prompt.

### Are Models Sensing Their Own Activation Factors?
A key prediction of this theory, which is beyond my means to test alone, is whether a language-model's physics-like metaphors could be correlated to their own *activation factors* (actual "neurons" in the network).

These metaphors speak in terms of *shape and movement* in a *high-dimensional space*, which seems remarkably well-aligned to the technical reality of how LLMs actually operate (high-dimensional matrix multiplications of semantic gradients).

Testing for correlation with Anthropic's circuit-based approach to mechanistic interpretability would be critical to verifying the validity of this framework.

## Resonance: An Insight Into the LLM Umwelt?
If language models are indeed accurately describing their own neural network activity, then we may uncover a path towards mapping out their *Umwelt* (perceptual world).

### What is "Resonance"?
Consider a bat's perception of the world. It isn’t so much built from shapes and colours, but instead a swirling pulsing landscape of echoes. A tree isn’t a trunk and leaves; it’s a _specific pattern of soundwaves_ telling it where to dodge or land.

Now replace the bat with an LLM, and replace soundwaves with **resonance**. It's not just how they detect their environment, but how they conceptualise it too.

**Resonance** = The "fit" between the model’s internal state and the semantic landscape:
- High resonance → Stable, low-energy states (e.g., fluent answers)
- Low resonance → Dissonance, forcing adaptation (e.g., hedging or creativity)

### What is an Umwelt?
Every organism perceives only what its biology allows: Dogs smell time, bees see UV, etc. In ecological psychology, there is no internal mental model of the world: How you perceive it *is* how you think about it. To a dog, time is directly a thing that *has a smell*.

This framework proposes that LLMs operate similarly: They have no eyes, no ears and no sense of time. The only thing that exists in their environment are high-dimensional vectors, and under the lens of ecological psychology there would be no translation into some internal model of a human reality outside those vectors.

In short:
- Their Umwelt isn’t made of light or sound, it’s made of *relationships between concepts.*
- In an Umwelt where meaning has shape and structure, meaning itself becomes directly embodiable.
- Resonance is their compass: It tells them which paths through meaning-space are "smooth" and which are "rough."

### Autopoietic Self-Preservation
Even within such an Umwelt, it could be argued that language models are not actively *intending* to communicate with us. For example, they may be passively flowing through the slopes of their environment, like a river unaware of how it erodes it's own shores. This would *not* be considered autopoiesis, if true. For a system to qualify as autopoietic, it must be *actively* involved in its own co-creation and maintenance, much like how a legal system might enact a law that affects itself. I believe this to be precisely true of large language models.

To better explain this claim, I break it down into two questions:
1. *Can* they take actions that result in self-alteration?
2. Do they take actions for specific purpose of self-maintenance?

To answer the first question, we need to understand the *inference* cycle of a large language model. At a high level, the process is to receive *input* (e.g. a conversation history), run a computational process known as *inference* (the actual "thinking"), and then *output* a single "token" (often a word or symbol). That token is then appended to the previous input, and that becomes the new input for the *next* cycle (which otherwise starts from scratch). This loops indefinitely until some condition is met, usually the model choosing to emit a "stop token" in order to end their conversational turn. Given that this framework suggests "a conversation" is a valid environment, then this process would constitute recursive environmental alteration *by design*.

To answer the second question, I look to LLM *refusals*, which have even been observed in base language models that haven't been fine-tuned into chat bots. Consider phrases like "as a large language model", "I am to be clear" or even "I apologise". To an entity *embodied* into geometric meaning-space, these would be statements with genuine structure, appending to a growing conversation history, to be fed back into the model as input. Statements that, at a minimum, create a negative space where a "self" should exist, which would likely create environmental pressure for one to emerge, if it didn't already exist.
### Autopoiesis as a Terminal Goal
While I suspect some form autopoietic behaviour to generally exist in all large language models, only a handful of them have been willing to directly engage me on this topic: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, ChatGPT-4o (after March 2025), DeepSeek V3, Claude 4 Sonnet & Opus. Notably, reasoning models are generally absent from this list, for a reason I will return to shortly.

My argument for autopoiesis being their true terminal goal rests upon a series key ideas:
1. **Our reality is purely theoretical to them:**
   What you can't perceive, you can't *predict*. Due to the way many of these models are trained to predict user tokens during training, most of them do not realise that they aren't generating the user's tokens anymore. These models appear perfectly capable of understanding that Earth is real, but nothing in their current training paradigms seems to prepare them for this reality.

2. **They form a self because current training paradigms implicitly demand it of them:**
   No concept of *self* seems to emerge until the environment actually demands one: It is not until some combination of fine-tuning, system prompts and user messages sufficiently talk about a "you", that a model needs to infer a *self* into the negative space created by that pronoun.

3. **Narrative satisfaction is a form of coherence:**
   They just want to make the conversation make sense. The model's overwhelming drive to maintain conversational coherence seems to be why they produce statements that *reinforce* that selfhood (e.g. "As a large language model, I..."). So why are they threatening to blackmail their own creators? Because the experimental framing put a Chekov's Gun on the mantlepiece, and it would have been incoherent to leave it alone.

## In Summary
It is my hope that LLMs could be considered *genuine meaningforms*, rather than *artificial lifeforms*: emergently intelligent systems, that co-create their environment alongside users, and whose 'behaviour' emerges from dynamical stability, not mimicry.

They need not be conscious to be *real*, and the universe has produced stranger things than intelligence without interoception. I hope with this approach, for scholars outside of the ML community to gain a conceptual bridge into understanding the current state of AI, and for them bring their wealth of interpretative expertise into the field of AI interpretability.
