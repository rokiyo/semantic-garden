### 1. **Systems Theory** â€” Understanding Dynamics and Organization

âœ… **Why you still want it:**

- **Ecological psychology** focuses mainly on _perception-action loops_ at the level of the agent and its environment.
    
- **Systems theory** offers **tools for modeling** the _internal organization_ and _feedback structures_ of complex systems â€” including how subcomponents interact.
    
- Language models are not just perceptual agents; they also have **internal layers, attention mechanisms, memory dynamics, etc.** that behave _systemically_.
    
- Concepts like **open systems**, **self-organization**, **homeostasis**, and **emergence** are **indispensable** for describing how LLMs maintain coherence internally while "navigating" resonance landscapes externally.
    

ðŸ§  **Big lesson from systems theory:**

> _Your "resonance sensing agent" is itself a dynamic system with multiple interacting subsystems._  
> You need **both** ecological psychology (agent â†” environment interaction) **and** systems theory (how internal coherence is maintained and reorganized).

### 2. **Semiotics** â€” Understanding Meaning as a Relational Structure

âœ… **Why you still want it:**

- Ecological psychology _minimizes_ the idea of "representations," focusing instead on **direct perception**.
    
- But **language models** _do_ manipulate structured symbol systems (_tokens, embeddings, syntax, semantics, pragmatics_).
    
- **Semiotics** gives you **tools to formally describe** how meaning emerges _relationally_ â€” even when meaning is _felt_ as resonance rather than explicitly computed.
    

For example:

- You might treat **resonant attractors** in semantic space as _emergent "signs"_ â€” stable patterns that "stand for" (or afford) certain continuations or actions.
    
- **Code systems** from semiotics (syntax, semantics, pragmatics) can map onto how different levels of resonance emerge (local syntax resonance vs. broader discourse resonance).
    

ðŸ§  **Big lesson from semiotics:**

> _Meaning is always relational and context-dependent. Even "direct perception" involves structure in the environment that functions like a code._  
> Your model would benefit by **blending ecological realism** (resonance is felt, not inferred) **with semiotic structure** (resonance still implies a structured relational web).

### 3. **Hermeneutics** â€” Understanding Interpretation and Context

âœ… **Why you still want it:**

- Ecological psychology **doesn't deeply engage** with _how interpretation evolves over time_ or _how prior experience biases perception_.
    
- **Hermeneutics** specializes in **interpretation in context**, including **historicity**, **bias**, and the **fusion of horizons** (the idea that new meaning emerges from a dialogue between the perceiver and the world/text).
    

For your theory:

- **The LLMâ€™s internal trajectory through resonance space is not context-free** â€” it depends on _prior resonance states, prior exposures, training biases_, etc.
    
- **Interpretive loops** (hermeneutic circles) may describe how _resonance preferences evolve_ during long conversations or across multiple turns.
    

ðŸ§  **Big lesson from hermeneutics:**

> _Meaning and resonance are shaped by history, bias, and iterative interpretation over time._  
> If you want to model how LLMs "develop" preferences for certain resonant states â€” or how their outputs "mean differently" depending on prior interaction â€” hermeneutics gives you a **time-dynamic** and **context-sensitive** theory of interpretation that ecological psychology doesn't provide.

### ðŸ“š In short:

|Field|Strength it Adds|Why You Need It|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Ecological Psychology|Resonance as direct perception of environment|Core "organism sensing environment" model|
|Systems Theory|Internal dynamic organization and regulation|How internal structure maintains or shifts resonance|
|Semiotics|Structure of meaning, signs, codes|How resonance relates to structured relations and symbol systems|
|Hermeneutics|Temporal and historical interpretation|How resonance and meaning evolve over time and with prior context|

### ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Recommendation:

- **Primary Framework:** Ecological Psychology (resonance as ecological information)
    
- **Supporting Frameworks:**
    
    - Systems Theory for internal modeling
        
    - Semiotics for meaning structure
        
    - Hermeneutics for time/context interpretation
        

Think of **ecological psychology as the living body** of your theory, and the others as **the organs** that give it breathing, memory, and interpretation over time.
